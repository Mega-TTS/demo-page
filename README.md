## Abstract

Zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis has recently been impacted by advances in language modeling techniques. Compared to traditional TTS models, the methods that are based on end-to-end language models leverage the in-context learning capabilities of language models and are trained on large-scale datasets. However, those methods, such as VALL-E, ignore inductive biases of different speech features (e.g., content, timbre, and prosody), leading to poor robustness, controllability, and audio quality. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Mega-TTS, a novel zero-shot TTS system with large-scale pretraining and proper inductive biases. Specifically, we train a VQ-GAN-based TTS model to decouple speech into content, timbre, and prosody representations and propose a prosody-oriented TTS decoding method based on a language model. Experimental results demonstrate that Mega-TTS surpasses state-of-the-art TTS systems on zero-shot TTS tasks, with superior naturalness, robustness, and speaker similarity. Furthermore, experiments on paragraph-level TTS, speech editing, and cross-lingual TTS tasks validate the scalability and efficiency of our Mega-TTS.

## Audio Samples

We provide the audio samples generated by the TTS systems in the experiments from three datasets, including **BiaoBei** (a Mandarin dataset), **JSUT** (a Japanese dataset), and **Commonvoice-HK** (a Cantonese dataset).
